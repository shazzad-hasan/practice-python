"""
In this project, we I will translate sequence of DNA into sequence of Amino acids.
Example:
    DNA sequence: ATACAATGGCAA
    Amino acids sequence: IQWQ

We will first download a DNA sequence, translate the DNA sequence into amino acids and then
download amino acid sequence to check our solution. 

Tasks:
    1. Manually download DNA and protein sequence data
    2. Import the DNA data into Python
    3. Create an algorithm to translate the DNA
    4. Check if translation matches downloaded amino acid sequence
